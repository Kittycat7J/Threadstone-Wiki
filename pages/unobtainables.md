This page is about items, entities and blocks that cannot be obtained without glitches, but which can be obtained using threadstone exploits.

# Introduction

This page lists unusual things which you can get using threadstone, that stay around after restarting the server.

The big applications are:
1. Unobtainable items
2. Water in the Nether
3. Nether Portals in the End

The method for getting water in the nether is horrible in vanilla.

Nether Portals in the End can be used to build [hyperlink networks](hyperlink.md).

# Items

Items that can be obtained using [falling block swaps](falling-block/falling-block-swaps.md):
- Bedrock
- End Portal Frame
- Spawner
- Barrier
- Command Block
- Repeat Command Block
- Chain Command Block
- Structure Block
- Silverfish Stone
- Farmland
- Grass Path
- Chorus Stem
- Structure Void
- Large Fern

The large fern item is a bit more difficult than the others. In 1.14+ large fern items are naturally generated in village chests, so getting it in 1.12 might not be worth it.

Items that can be obtained through [word tearing](word-tearing.md):
- Petrified Oak Slab
- Shrub

Shrub items get converted into dead bushes in 1.13+.

Items that can be obtained through async inventory updates:
- Player Head

Items that can only be obtained after upgrading from 1.12 to more recent versions:
- Silverfish cobblestone, stonebricks, mossy stonebricks, cracked stonebricks, chiseled stonebricks

When a falling silverfish cobblestone entity drops an item, then in 1.12 it drops a normal silverfish stone item,
while in more recent versions it drops a silverfish cobblestone item.
This means silverfish cobblestone is completely unobtainable as an item in 1.12.
But if one creates a falling silverfish cobblestone entity in 1.12, and then upgrades to more recent versions,
then one can obtain a silverfish cobblestone item after upgrading.
The same goes for all silverfish stone variants.

Items that are COMPLETELY UNOBTAINABLE using all currently known methods:
- Mob Spawn Eggs

# Falling Block Entities
Every possible block id with every possible damange value can be created as a [falling block entity](falling-block/falling-block-entity.md), by first creating the block using [word tearing](word-tearing.md) and then performing a [falling block swap](falling-block/falling-block-swaps.md).

Some falling blocks are only interesting because they drop interesting items, and have no utility beyond that. For example, a falling end portal frame is only interesting because it drops an end portal frame item.

But there are also falling blocks which are useful as falling blocks.

Falling blocks that are useful as falling blocks, because the items they drop are unusable:
- Command Block
- Repeat Command Block
- Chain Command Block
- Structure Block

Falling blocks that are useful as falling blocks, even though they drop no item:
- Nether Portal
- End Gateway
- End Portal

Falling Nether Portals are useful, because they can be used to create nether portals in the end.

Falling blocks that are not very interesting in 1.12, but become interesting after updating to more recent versions:
- Block 36
- Piston Head
- Silverfish stone variants

Falling block 36 and falling piston heads cannot land at all in 1.12. They turn into air when they land.
In more recent versions they can land, and enable one to create block 36 or multi-headed pistons, without having to crash the server in an update suppression.

Silverfish stone variants are interesting after upgrading, because after upgrading do they drop the silverfish stone variant item with the correct damage value.

Falling Blocks that are memes:
- Downwards facing headless piston
- Unlocked hopper

Falling downwards facing headless pistons could be used for bedrock breaking. Without flying savestates that duplicate the falling headless pistons, this concept doesn't seem to go very far.
Unlocked hoppers are a source of lag in storage systems, much to the dismay of all those for whom storage tech is a passion.

# Blocks
Every possible block id with every possible damange value can be created as a block using [word tearing](word-tearing.md).

Interesting examples are:
- Water in the Nether
- Petrified Oak Slabs
- Shrubs
- Seamless Stone Double Slabs
- All Bark Logs

Falling Nether Portals can be used to create:
- Nether Portals in the End


# Miscellaneous

You can insert shields into jukeboxes.
