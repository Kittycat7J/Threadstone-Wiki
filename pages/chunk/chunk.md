Space in Minecraft is separated into Chunks
The following mechanics are related to chunks.

# Loading
When a chunk is loaded it immediately checks whether a [terrain population](population.md) should occur, and immediately executes it if it should occur.

## Chunk swaps: Loading already loaded chunks
## Overworld RNG manipulation via Chunk Loading

# Unloading

## Saving
After a chunk is unloaded, it gets saved to disk.
Chunk saving can be prevented using [chunk savestates](savestate.md).
